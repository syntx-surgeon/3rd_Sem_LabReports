// C program to demonstrate the Painter's Algorithm for 2D object rendering
// using the graphics.h library.
// This program sorts the objects based on their depth (z-value) and draws them in the correct order.
// The program uses a simple bubble sort to sort the objects by depth and then draws them from farthest to nearest.
// The objects are represented as rectangles with specified coordinates, depth, and color.
// The program uses the graphics.h library for rendering the objects on the screen.
// The user is prompted to enter the number of objects and their properties (coordinates, depth, and color).
// The program then sorts the objects based on depth and draws them in the correct order using the Painter's Algorithm.
// also known as the "depth sorting" algorithm, is a technique used in computer graphics to render overlapping objects correctly by drawing them in the correct order based on their depth (z-value).
// It is commonly used in 2D and 3D graphics to ensure that objects closer to the viewer are drawn on top of those that are farther away.
